## What This Is

The HR Analytics Fabric Catalog is a collection of tested patterns, best practices, and implementation guidance for building
comprehensive people analytics solutions using Microsoft Fabric. This catalog brings together patterns for data organization,
transformation, governance, business intelligence, machine learning, and more—specifically tailored for HR analytics use cases.

Whether you're building your first HR analytics solution or modernizing an existing one, this catalog provides:

- **8 Domain Areas:** Comprehensive coverage from data organization through data sharing
- **93 Patterns:** Tested approaches with complexity assessments, governance considerations, and use cases
- **Implementation Guidance:** Practical instructions, code examples, and best practices
- **Governance Focus:** Special attention to the unique security and compliance requirements of HR data

This catalog reflects real-world implementations and lessons learned from organizations building analytics platforms
on Microsoft Fabric. It's designed to help you move faster while avoiding common pitfalls.

## Quick Start

### Using the Pattern Builder HTML App
1. Open the [live Pattern Builder](https://warlab01.github.io/hr-analytics-fabric-catalog/pattern-builder.html) or open `pattern-builder.html` locally in your browser
2. Browse patterns by domain, search by name, and explore relationships
3. Filter by complexity, maturity, and other attributes
4. Use the Use Case Blueprints tab to explore end-to-end implementation paths with alternative pattern options
5. Export pattern stacks and blueprint flow diagrams (SVG/HTML) for team discussions

### Using the Streamlit Application
```bash
cd streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```

The Streamlit app provides:
- Interactive pattern explorer
- Domain-specific views
- Pattern relationships and dependencies
- Implementation checklist generation

- Clear description of the pattern or improvement
- Real-world context and use cases
- Governance and compliance considerations
- Links to relevant documentation

## Governance Notes

### Data Sensitivity
This catalog focuses on patterns for handling sensitive HR and people data. All implementations should:

- Follow your organization's data classification standards
- Implement appropriate role-based access control (RBAC)
- Apply sensitivity labels to personal data
- Maintain audit trails of data access and transformations
- Comply with relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, local employment laws)

### Pattern Maturity
Patterns are marked with maturity levels:
- **GA (General Availability):** Fully supported and recommended for production use
- **Preview:** Available but may change; use with caution
- **Experimental:** Research stage; evaluate carefully before production use

### Complexity Assessment
Patterns are assessed for implementation complexity:
- **Low:** Can be implemented in days with basic skills
- **Medium:** Requires expertise; 1-3 weeks typical implementation
- **High:** Requires significant expertise and planning; 3+ weeks typical
